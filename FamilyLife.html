<h1>Family Life</h1>

<p>
One of the most important aspects of my life has been my large family. Below is a list of all my siblings who made my life interesting to say the least.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Lindsay McChesney</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Lindsay is my oldest sibling. We became close in recent years, but with our 8 year age gap, we weren't always the best of friends. Nowadays, Lindsay works in software development at a company called <a href="https://www.ninjaone.com/">Ninja</a>. Her and her husband, Cameron McChesney, have three cats, two chinchillas, and a new golden retriever puppy.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Michael Beisheim</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Michael is the brainiest of the bunch. He graduated from the University of Michigan in 2018 with a degree in Industrial and Operations Engineering. He now works in New York City and works as a day trader.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Ben Beisheim</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Ben has been my most consistent friend throughout childhood. Being the closest to me in age, only three years older than I, we spent a lot of time together. While this time was not spent without lots of brotherly bullying, I always knew he was someone who cared for me. Nowadays, he works at a restaurant in downtown NYC and lives with Michael.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
