<h1>Pets</h1>

<p>
I <i>love</i> animals. Always have, always will. Here are the pets I have currently:
</p>

<h2>Columbia Kitties</h2>

Above we see my two babies I have down here in Columbia, Honey (orange) and Cleo (black with the cone of shame). They are a fiesty duo.
</p>

<h2>Hometown Homies</h2>

Here we have my kitty I have at home, Annabelle, as well as my puppy who unfortunately passed away recently, Daisy.
